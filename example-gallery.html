				  <p>JaVale McGee is a pretty cool dude. There is really no disputing that. While rocking a black #JUGLIFE dad hat — with a brand new, unopened drone in his hand — the nine-year veteran quietly answered questions outside the Warriors’ locker room following the team’s 109-86 beatdown of the Kings. He wasn’t asked about the clean water well that his foundation helped build in Uganda, which brings fresh water to over 500 school children. Nor was he asked about his love for filmmaking — hence, the drone. More importantly, he was grilled about why he and so many of his teammates have decided to sport headbands as of late. The topic was certainly on everyone’s mind.</p>

				  <p>There is no one foolproof method for determining which conference is the best in college basketball. There is no one metric, no one methodology, and heck, in this case, no one definition of “best.”</p>
				  <p>There is, however, one sure-fire way to spark discussion, and eventually argument, and that is to suggest that a given conference is indeed superior to all the rest. So that’s what I’ll do to open this week’s Power Rankings, and not just because I’m feeling hot-takey; rather, because I find the case for one conference far more compelling than the rest.</p>
