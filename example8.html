					<p><span style="font-size:24px">JaVale McGee</span> is a pretty cool dude. There is really no disputing that. While rocking a black #JUGLIFE dad hat — with a brand new, unopened drone in his hand — the nine-year veteran quietly answered questions outside the Warriors’ locker room following the team’s 109-86 beatdown of the Kings. He wasn’t asked about the clean water well that his foundation helped build in Uganda, which brings fresh water to over 500 school children. Nor was he asked about his love for filmmaking — hence, the drone. More importantly, he was grilled about why he and so many of his teammates have decided to sport headbands as of late. The topic was certainly on everyone’s mind.</p>
