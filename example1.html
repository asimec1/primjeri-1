<div><h1>Bradley Beal doesn't get why Carmelo Anthony made the All-Star team over him</h1>
<p>Bradley Beal is enjoying a career year for the Eastern Conference’s third-place team, and his impact on the Washington Wizards’ success since the schedule entered December is worthy of an All-Star bid.</p>

And the 23-year-old Wizards sharpshooter doesn’t quite get it.</p></div>
